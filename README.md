# Snow-Retreat-Grouper

This is an application that helps group people so that they are with people that they want to be with. This was first created to help my church create cabin groups. Thus, there are some hard coded specifications in the code for exactly this purpose. They are as follows:

- must split the groups between girls and boys
- each person must select three other people they want to be with
- cabins are hard coded in


I am going to first finish this specialized version and then see if I can completely generalize the program so that you can make groups out of anything based on any attribute and being able to weigh certain things more than other.



GUI will be coming soon but currently, using the console is easier.
