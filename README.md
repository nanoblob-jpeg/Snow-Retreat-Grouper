# Snow-Retreat-Grouper

This is an application that helps group people so that they are with people that they want to be with. This was first created to help my church create cabin groups. Thus, there are some hard coded specifications in the code for exactly this purpose. They are as follows:

- must split the groups between girls and boys
- each person must select three other people they want to be with
- cabins are hard coded in


A generalization of sorts with this many connections is something that I am not ready to tacklet yet, so this project is going to stay like this. Instructions on how to use it follow:

When prompted for the number of participants, you MUST give the exact number. This is the number of participants not counting counselors.


Next, the program will prompt you for how many counselors are going to be inside each of the cabins.


Finally, you will be asked to insert a list of participants. They MUST be in the right format or else the program WILL NOT work. All names for the same people need to be spelled the same or else this program WILL NOT work.
